##User Stories
As developers, we want to create an interface that is easy and enjoyable for the user to interact with. We want to accomplish this through the use of simple text and images.

As developers, we want the user to be able to use our site to meet their needs. We want to do this by providing a centralized resource for food services offered in the Seattle metropolitan area. We want this list to be easy to interpret. We want the user to be able to filter the list based on their location and by time in order to narrow down all available services to just the ones that meet their current need.

As developers we want to provide users a way to make a reservation at the location of their choice. This process will serve two purposes. For the user, it will ensure that they receive the service that they need at the time of their choosing. For the service provider, it will give them helpful information about how many individuals they will need to plan to accommodate at a given time for a particular meal.
